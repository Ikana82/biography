          <h4>Early Life</h4>
          <h2>Who was Vincent van Gogh?</h2>
          <p>
            Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in
            Groot-Zundert, The Netherlands. The son of a pastor, he worked as an
            art dealer, teacher, and preacher in Borinage, Belgium, before
            finally turning to art in 1881 with the support of his brother,
            Theo.
            <br /><br />
            In a short but intense decade, he created approximately
            <strong>2,100 artworks</strong>, including around 860 oil paintings.
            Most of his masterpieces were created during the last two years of
            his life—a time marked by mental turbulence yet profound artistic
            productivity.

            <h3>Early Period: The Netherlands (1881-1885)</h3>
            <p>
              Vincent began his career painting peasant life in Nuenen. His work
              was dominated by somber earth tones, lacking the vivid colors that
              would later become his trademark. "The Potato Eaters" (1885) was
              his first major achievement in social realism.

            <p>
              Living with Theo in Montmartre, Vincent met the Impressionists.
              His color palette changed drastically, becoming brighter. He was
              also deeply influenced by Japanese woodblock prints (Ukiyo-e),
              which altered his perspective on composition.

              Seeking intense sunlight, he moved to Arles and rented "The Yellow
              House" with dreams of establishing an artist community. Paul
              Gauguin joined him, but tensions rose, culminating in the infamous
              ear-cutting incident in December 1888.

              Vincent voluntarily entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum.
              Despite battling mental attacks, he remained prolific. Here, he
              painted "The Starry Night," which was the view from his bedroom
              window just before sunrise.

              In May 1890, he moved to Auvers to be closer to Theo and Dr. Paul
              Gachet. On July 27, he shot himself in a wheat field and died 30
              hours later from the infection. His final words to Theo were: "The
              sadness will last forever."
